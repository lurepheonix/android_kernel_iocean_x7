This is a kernel source for MT6589

Actually the list of supported devices :
	iOCEAN X7

Supposing you`re building on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr (which is the latest for now) and you have only the old 32bit machine like me.
Dependencies:
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi ncurses-dev
This installs armeabi toolchain, which is already 4.8 for this Ubuntu version. 4.8 is needed.

How to build:
cd <directory>
export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-
export PROJECT=vanzo89_wet_jb2
make menuconfig (if you want to set up something)
make
